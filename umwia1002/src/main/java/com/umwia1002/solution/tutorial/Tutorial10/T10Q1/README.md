# About T10Q1

No worries, it's okay if you can't understand the code. Myself don't understand it as well :) I just copy and paste the code online and debug it using chatGPT.

The code compares the performance of three searching algorithms: `linear search`, `iterative binary search`, and `recursive binary search`. The comparison is based on the time each algorithm takes to find the index of a given element in an array. To obtain a reliable and representative result, the testing is repeated a number of times specified by the constant `REPEAT`.

The graph generated by the code shows that as the size of the array increases, the time taken by linear search also increases linearly, in line with its time complexity of O(n). In contrast, the time taken by binary search seems to converge to a point, and the graph exhibits a logarithmic shape, consistent with its time complexity of O(log n).

To reproduce the results of the code, you need to download and add the `jFreeChart` library to your build path.
