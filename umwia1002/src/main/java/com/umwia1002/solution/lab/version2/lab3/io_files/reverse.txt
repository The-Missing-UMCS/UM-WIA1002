I think we’ve seen more of a cultural shift, where Ukraine has had its sense of identity strengthened and is being politically pushed more towards the West by Russia’s aggression.

I think it’s too early to talk about areas of appeasement, given the level of hostilities between the two countries.

You could argue that if soldiers are treated reasonably well – which hasn’t always been the case – it could lessen their desire to fight, should they find themselves deployed once more.

Thousands of prisoners of war are continuing to be exchanged.

What we’ve seen is quite a successful prisoner exchange programme running in parallel with the fighting, with little to no diplomatic relations between Kyiv and Moscow elsewhere.
